Create a few class that extend each other and show in console initialization order od static, no-static blocks and constructors

A, B extends A, C extends B

Initialization static variable in class A
Call static block initilization in class A
Initialization static variable in class B
Call static block initilization in class B
Initialization static variable in class C
Call static block initilization in class C
Initialization no-static variable in class A
Call no-static block initilization in class A
Call constructor in class A
Initialization no-static variable in class B
Call no-static block initilization in class B
Call constructor in class B
Initialization no-static variable in class C
Call no-static block initilization in class C
Call constructor in class C
